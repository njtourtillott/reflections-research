Reflection 13

This week I chose to focus on a research article in the realm of data literacy. Specifically, this study looked at the relationship between higher education students and stakeholders in their success and how the data literacy of those stakeholders impacts the success of their students. I found this study personally interesting for a couple different reasons: 1. I'm a student in a higher education setting and knowing what to look for in good rolemodels and stakeholders is really helpful 2. This is a unique study in that most data literacy studies related to student success focus on the students data literacy, not that of the stake holders, putting this study in a unique position.

Overall the study stresses the importance of data literacy in said stakeholders and highlights that student success is not reliant solely on the skills of the student, but on those of their mentors aswell. This is something that I feel like is often overlooked and the sucess or failrue of a student is often but on them and them alone, however its important not to forget those who support them in their efforts.
