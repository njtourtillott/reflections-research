This week I looked at a review article in the realm of Biovisualization. More specifically it dives into methods of genomic visualization and how effective and interactive methods of this are at the core of many biological discoveries. Now when we say genomic visualizations we’re not just talking about the linear sequence of nucleotides on a chromosome. We’re basically talking about visualizations of gene structure, protein structure, gene interactions, cellular infrastructure, and expression data. 

This review is unique because it stresses the importance of developing more interactive visualizations, specifically when talking about structures and interactions between those. This paper collectively speaks about the use of VR in the bioviz space, as well as other computationally generated models– stressing their importance in exploratory studies and how these methods will likely shape the next generation of biological discoveries.
