Reflection 12

Following my article from last week that highlighted the shift in the political landscape that was the 2016 election and how the fake news movement was something the viz community should be well aware of, I've elected to go further down this rabbit hole. Now I've found an article about the essential information war that is taking place on the internet and showcases how a lack of national data literacy standards is one of the key drivers of the QAnon conspiracy movement. The article essentially dives into the tactics used by the conspriacy group to coopt and drive far right political groups. Moreover the article describes how our progressive acceptance of the internet and social media platforms have allowed for such a movement to take root in our political system.

Essentially, we have more access to data, information, and visualizations than we ever have. Nearly each of us have access to a near endless amount of information from our phones and computers. However, our country lacks any standards for recognizing false or tampered data and misleading visualizations. This has left a large portion of our population vulnerable to the mass spread of misinformation and an accpetance of conspiracy theories as the new reality. This exact weakness has been the main driver of the QAnon movement that is tearing through our country and it is the exact disconnect they wish to worsen in order to maintain power.
