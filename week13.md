Reflection 11

For this week's research article I got inspired by our past discussions on graph perception and literacy in regards to fake news. So while this article is not directly related to data viz and certainly did not come out of the viz community, it does have some pretty large implications for how we approach data viz and communication to combat this rising issue of fake news. To no one's surpize the article finds a massive increase in the use of fake news around the 2016 election and on ward. This increase was also marked by a drastic shift in its conceptual use and drastic shift in its polarity.

At risk of outing myself as someone left of the demonstably centerist democratic party, it also comes to no surpize that this shift in the term sprang forth from basket of deplorables that is the trump base. Like I said, this article is not necessarily related to data viz, however its worth taking notice of because it designates a shift in the sociopolitcal landscape of the US. Now more than ever, we must be aware that most visualizations will be take out of context or contorted to display what the fake news crowd wants to see, and their reaction to unmanipulated data that contrasts their beliefs is simply fake. I obviously dont have a way to combat their cult like menality and disconncet from reality, but its something we should all be aware of in the data viz community and as scientists in general.
