For this week’s visualization I opted for something less directly related to general data viz and more specifically in the domain of bio viz. It is the publication for AlphaFold 2, an approach to protein structure prediction developed and published by Deepmind. While it relies on other previously available visualization methods to visualize the predicted 3D structure of an input amino acid sequence it is nearly revolutionary in the bioinformatics world. Being able to reliably predict the 3D structure of a protein solely from its amino acid sequence is essentially the holy grail of bioinformatics and biomedicine, because if the method can reliably perform at or above the metrics of experimental methods used to validate protein structures the scientific community could then reliably design proteins for nearly any function since form equals function when it comes to proteins.

AlphaFold 2, can do just that. At least when it comes to human proteins and the equivalents which it was tested against. The protein folding question is one bioinformaticians have been attempting to answer for decades now, but the fact that AlphaFold 2 can reasonably compete with experimental methods is already a huge advance in biomedical research and honestly all reaches of biology.
