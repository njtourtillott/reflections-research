For this week’s visualization I opted for something less directly related to general data viz and more specifically in the domain of bio viz. It’s a paper on Traumatic Brain Injuries. More specifically, it delves into the sex specific differences seen in those injuries. This paper is unique in that it is mainly computationally driven and relies on novel methods of data analysis and visualization to support its claims, something which is honestly rare in the biological domains.

This paper took a couple out of the box approaches to its visualizations. One of which were word clouds regarding self descriptors for patient symptoms. This was actually the first time I’ve seen a word cloud used in any scientific context, and was actually quite refreshing, because it doesn’t take a lot of brain power to parse and understand what the data has to say. Other interesting visualizations included heatmaps relating patient condition to environmental factors and bar charts to account for the type and severity of TBI in patients.
